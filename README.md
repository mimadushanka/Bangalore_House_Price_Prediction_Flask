##  Deployment Overview

### 1. **Server Setup**

- Provisioned an **Ubuntu EC2 instance**
- Installed Python, pipenv, and system packages
URL:- http://34.216.141.124/

### 2. **Gunicorn + Nginx**

- Used `Gunicorn` as WSGI HTTP server
- Configured `Nginx` as a reverse proxy
- Exposed port `80` in EC2 Security Group

### 3. **Systemd Service**

- Set up a `houseprice.service` to run Gunicorn in the background
- Enabled auto-start on server reboot
